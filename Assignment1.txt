Abstract = {Light painting is an artform where a light source is moved during a long-exposure shot, creating trails resembling a stroke on a canvas. It is very difficult to perform because the light source needs to be moved at the intended speed and along a precise trajectory. Additionally, images can be corrupted by the person moving the light. We propose computational light painting, which avoids such artifacts and is easy to use. Taking a video of the moving light as input, a virtual exposure allows us to draw the intended light positions in a post-process. We support animation, as well as 3D light sculpting, with high-quality results. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

@article{2006938520060301,
Abstract = {In this paper we propose a speed-up technique for a local automatic colour equalization operator derived from a model of the human vision system. This method is characterized by local and global filtering effects, that simultaneously achieve different equalization tasks e.g. performing colour and lightness constancy, realizing dynamic image data driven stretching, controlling the contrast. We describe a way to quickly create a filtering mapping function to perform the global component of the mapping. This method is based on singular value decomposition (SVD) applied to sampled and filtered points in the input image. Then, the local information is added computing the basic algorithm on a neighbourhood of each input pixel. A slight quality loss is the price that we have to pay for a speed-up of more than two orders of magnitude of the basic algorithm. We present the results on several images and discuss the efficiency and the drawbacks of the speed-up technique. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract="In this paper, we present a new greedy algorithm for surface reconstruction from unorganized point sets. Starting from a seed facet, a piecewise linear surface is grown by adding Delaunay triangles one by one. The most plausible triangles are added first and in such a way as to prevent the appearance of topological singularities. The output is thus guaranteed to be a piecewise linear orientable manifold, possibly with boundary. Experiments show that this method is very fast and achieves topologically correct reconstruction in most cases. Moreover, it can handle surfaces with complex topology, boundaries, and nonuniform sampling. ",
