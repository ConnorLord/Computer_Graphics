Final Project part 3-README

My submission for the fifth week of the final project progress uses the open source 
javascript library three.js. At the moment, I have incorporated a few features into my 
code, these abilities are transform controls. My object can now be translated, rotated, 
and scaled. I also have the ability to toggle if the tools being used for these features 
will remain stationary to the screen, or be transformed with the object i.e. if the 
object is rotated the tool can either rotate with the object, or remain stationary. This 
feature does not apply to the scale feature. A feature to make the tools larger or smaller 
to the object has also been incorporated, so if the object is zoomed in on, the tools can 
be shrunk so that size isn't an issue. Finally there is the ablity to have the object's 
transformation features snap to a grid, so that if the object is translated, it will only 
move in increments of the grid in view. I have been trying to incorporate the ability to 
draw on a canvas, which will then put the drawing onto the sides of the object. 
Unfortunately I haven't been able to get this to work. I have been using the tutorials 
found at https://threejs.org/examples/ , the website that the three.js library can be 
found from. The html file is called more_progress.html.
