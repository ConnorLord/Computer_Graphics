Computer Graphics Final report week 1

At this point in development, the only thing that is required to run this webpage is two javascripts files,
that need to be included in the same directory that the html file is in. These files webgl-utils.js and 
glMatrix-0.9.5.min.js were provided from a tutorial website that I was using to learn OpenGL called 
http://learningwebgl.com/blog/?p=239. Nothing on the page is clickable at the moment, so nothing else is 
necessary to use this webpage.
