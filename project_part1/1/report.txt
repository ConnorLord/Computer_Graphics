Final Project part 1-README

Although there are many features that need to be implimented for the final project, for this first entry,
I do not have any of them totally implimented. This is because due to my busy schedule, I had to commit a 
good deal of time learning how to use OpenGl, so that I may have the skills to complete the rest of this 
project. For this first report, all my webpage does is display a few rotating shapes that are colored. This 
is the very simple first step to being able to implement all of the necessary features for this assignment. 
To learn how to do this, I started following a simple tutorial that I found online at:
http://learningwebgl.com/blog/?p=239
which provided enough insight into how to start this project. This also why what I have is similar to lesson 
3 of this tutorial, as I was simply following along, for now.
