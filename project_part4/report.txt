Final Project part 3-README

My submission for the fourth week of the final project progress uses the open source 
javascript library three.js. At the moment, I have incorporated a few features into my 
code, the abilty to have multiple views of an object, the ability to zoom into one of 
the windows, as well as the ability to zoom and pan around the object. I have been trying 
to incorporate the ability to draw on a canvas, which will then put the drawing onto the 
sides of the object. Unfortunately I haven't been able to get this to work. I have been 
using the tutorials found at https://threejs.org/examples/ , the website that the 
three.js library can be found from. The html file is called more_progress.html.
