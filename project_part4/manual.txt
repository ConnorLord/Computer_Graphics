Computer Graphics Final report week 1

My webpage has three windows, each showing a different view, where the first window 
is interectable. The top of the page says that using the mouse, the user can rotate 
the object by holding the left mouse button and dragging the mouse. The user can pan 
the object around by doing the same process as rotate, except while holding the right 
mouse button. By scrolling the mouse wheel, the user can zoom in and out from the object. 
The canvas on the side of the screen can be drawn on, but unfortunately it's full 
functionality is unfinished at this point.
