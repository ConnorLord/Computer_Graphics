Computer Graphics Final report week 1

At this point in development, the only thing that is required to run this webpage is the javascripts files 
in my js libary from my main directory. From here there are a few things that can be used to operate the page. 
By holding the left mouse button on the page, and then moving the mouse, the object on screen can then be 
rotated around. The right mouse button will perform similarly, but will pan the page in the direction the 
mouse is moving. The middle mouse button (scroll wheel) operates similarly as well, but is used for moving the 
camera closer or farther away.
