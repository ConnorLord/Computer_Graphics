Final Project part 2-README

Unlike my previous submission, which was a dead end, my submission for the second week 
of the final project progress uses the open source javascript library three.js. This 
library is an easier way to use WebGL to create 3d models in a browser page. At the 
moment, I have one major feature implemented in my code, and that it the ability to 
orient a camera around a model, which for now is just a cube. I am currently working 
on how to have multiple views of the same object, from different angles. To do this, I 
have been using the tutorials found at https://threejs.org/examples/ , the website that 
the three.js library can be found from.
