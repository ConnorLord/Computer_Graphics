Final Project part 3-README

My submission for the third week of the final project progress uses the open source 
javascript library three.js. At the moment, I trying to incorporate two features into 
my code, multiple views, and the ability to rotate the camera; to great diffulty... To 
do this, I have been using the tutorials found at https://threejs.org/examples/ , the 
website that the three.js library can be found from. I would like to get a lot more done 
for this project in the coming weeks, I hope I have enough time. The html file is called 
more_progress.html.
