Computer Graphics Final report week 1

My webpage has three windows, each showing a different view, where the first window 
is interectable. The top of the page says that using the mouse, the user can rotate 
the object by holding the left mouse button and dragging the mouse. The user can pan 
the object around by doing the same process as rotate, except while holding the right 
mouse button. By scrolling the mouse wheel, the user can zoom in and out from the object. 
Transformation tools have been added. The three main tools are a translation tool, a 
rotation tool, and a scaling tool. These three features are toggled between each other, 
by pressing "W" for translation, "E" for rotation, and "R" for scaling, the default tool 
is translation. These tools appear on each of the three views on the object. The tools 
consist of three red, blue, and green objects for each feature, each of which effect one 
of the three dimensions of the object. To use these tools, simply move the cursor to the 
center of the screen, until one of these tools lights up on all three views, then click 
and hold the left mouse button, and move the mouse to effect the object. The translation 
tool moves the in one of the three dimensions. The rotation tool rotates the object around 
one of the three dimensions. The scaling tool will stretch or shrink the object along one 
of the three dimensions. Pressing "+" and "-" will increase and decrease the size of tools 
for ease of use. Pressing "Q" will toggle whether the tools are effected by the 
transformations, or if the tools will always face the user. Holding "Ctrl" will cause the 
transformations applied to only work in increments of the visible grid on the screen.
